# 7-Wonders-Scoring

## Version 5

* Simple app prototype with two games - 7 Wonders and King/Queendomino
* First screen is game chooser and player name/type entry - list of players names built and shown
* Second screen is dynamic to number of players, and sets up score tracks based on chosen game
* Totals are tracked dynamically
