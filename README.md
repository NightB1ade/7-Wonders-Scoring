# 7-Wonders-Scoring

## Version 1

* Very simple app prototype to demo functionality
* First screen is player name entry - list of players names built and shown below
* Second screen is hardcoded to 2 players and shows 4 score tracks

## Next steps
Brain dump - will not be everything

- [ ] don't allow zero players
- [ ] make score tracks dynamic based on read in data config?
- [ ] make number players dynamic based on first screen
- [ ] add total track
