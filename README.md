# 7-Wonders-Scoring

## Version 2

* Very simple app prototype
* First screen is player name entry - list of players names built and shown below
* Second screen is dynamic to number of players but hardcoded to 4 score tracks

## Next steps
Brain dump - will not be everything

- [x] don't allow zero players
- [x] make number players dynamic based on first screen
- [x] default player names to "player X" and pre-selected for easy edit/entry
- [ ] make score tracks dynamic based on read in data config?
- [ ] add total track
- [ ] allow removal of players on first screen?
- [ ] player name editing
- [ ] menu to reset and return to main screen
- [ ] menu to configure tracks
