        Just enter the scores per player for each of the score tracks for the game, and the totals will be calculated as you go in the Total track.\n
        \n
        If you need more information about a particular score track or help calculating the score you can activate the score helper dialog by either:\n
        1) performing a long press on a single score entry to edit that score only; or\n
        2) pressing on the score track name to edit every players score in turn for that track.\n
        \n
        The score helper dialog provides hints about the score that needs to be entered and has auto-calculation help for that particular scoring track.\n
        For more complicated scoring tracks it may offer a sub-total button that allows you to calculate multiple scoring parts before setting the final total for that track.
